# models-cpp
Some models, mostly cellular automata, written in C++ with SDL2.

## Compiling
You need the SDL2 headers and static libraries. You can probably get them from <http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php>.

Each of the models is intended to compile into an independant executable.

## Running
Download the SDL2 runtime binaries, or build them from source: <http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php>.
